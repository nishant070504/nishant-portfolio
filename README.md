# Responsive Web Design Projects

This repository contains my personal submissions for the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification.

All projects demonstrate core concepts of HTML and CSS, focusing on layout, responsiveness, and semantic structure.

These were built as part of my learning journey in web development.
